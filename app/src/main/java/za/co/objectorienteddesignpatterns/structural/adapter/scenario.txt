Usage examples:
The Adapter pattern is pretty common in Java code.
Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code.
In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.

Problem:
Fitting square pegs into round holes. Round holes, as you would assume, only accepts
round pegs based on shape. The radius of the peg is used to determine if the round
peg will fit in the round hole.

Solution:
Use the adapter pattern to create an adapter which accepts square pegs and
calculates the radius of the square peg.
