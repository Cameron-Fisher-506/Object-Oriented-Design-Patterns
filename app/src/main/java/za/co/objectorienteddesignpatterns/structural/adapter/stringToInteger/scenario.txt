Usage examples:
The Adapter pattern is pretty common in Java code.
Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code.
In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.

Problem:
Our system is a legacy Weather system which accepts and processes XML data from
a weather service. There's a new requirement to send the XML data to an
external Analytics system. The Analytics system accepts JSON data.

Solution:
We can use the adapter pattern to create an adapter which converts the XML to JSON.
For this example we will use String and Integer for data types respectively.
